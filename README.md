# Crypted: README File

## Description
Crypted is a 2d Puzzle game where you discover unique cryptids and use their powers to solve the puzzles at hand to escape the crypts.

## Instructions to Start the Game
1. Unzip the provided folder.
2. Double-click the `.exe` file to launch the game.
3. No additional parameters or configuration files are required.

## Known Bugs
- **Rock/Stone Altar Glitch**: Occasionally, the snapping behavior of rocks and altars does not work correctly.
  - This bug primarily affects Level 2 (Freeing Mothman) and Level 3 (Final Level).
  - In Level 2, if this bug occurs, getting caught by the zookeeper will reset the level
  - To avoid this bug, approach each altar slowly, ensuring the rock is positioned correctly between Bigfoot and the altar.
- **Animation GLITCH**: If the player goes right first (as opposed to left) the characters will be incorrectly flipped
  - To fix this, just walk a few steps to the left first
  - Bigfoot automatically does this when the scene loads
  - **DIALOGUE GLITCH**: dialogue box is way too big for the screen, could  not fix in time. Kept changing with each commit to repo.
